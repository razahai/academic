# HUM Final Project

This is the culmination of my yearlong project for my junior HUM at TJHSST. We were tasked to create a multimedia essay about a topic relating to "Our American Story." I aimed to answer the question: 

<p align="center">
    <em>
        How does the accessibility and quality of transportation infrastructure contribute to wealth disparities in DC?
    </em>
</p>

This project is a 360° interactive video that shows an Uber driver driving around Washington D.C. and talking about the state of transportation infrastructure. All of the models in this video were extracted from GTA: San Andreas.
