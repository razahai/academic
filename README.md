# *academic*

Version control system for managing classes, assignments, files, etc. (mostly CS-based) To efficiently utilize this repository, there are scripts (one script at the moment) in the scripts/ directory to make life easier. I use Windows, only .bat files are provided. If you wish to do so, you can create the shell scripts yourself and commit to this repo (I don't know why you'd want to, but hey, I'll take it).

# Scripts

**ai-clean-commit** - Since my AI class has a grader that requires you to provide your full name, graduation year, and period at the bottom of your file, I have created a script to trim those sections off. *Essentially, I don't want to get doxxed (even though you can find me easily with a little bit of effort)*
