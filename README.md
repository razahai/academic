VCS for managing classes, assignments, files, etc. 

## Scripts

- `ai-clean-commit` - strips full name, graduation year, and class period from the bottom of each file in the `ai/` folder.
- `cv-clean-commit` - replaces ion username with "--" in each file in the `cv/` folder.

## Notes

- I no longer have access to my files from the following courses: Web Development, Mobile Apps Development, Accelerated Foundations of Computer Science, and AP Computer Science A+.
